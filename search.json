      "contents": "\nOverview\nModern economies consume (and produce) tens of thousands of chemicals. In some countries, regulators would like to assess each new chemical before it enters into its nominated use. This could require laboratory testing to determine chemical properties, such as persistence and toxicity. Ideally, regulators would be able to anticipate “emerging chemicals” which will adverse effects on human and environmental health (more concisely, AEs), and impose appropriate regulatory actions. \nHowever, as the case of PFAS (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) shows, regulators may not have the resources to collect data on all chemicals. Further, a regulator’s resources may be further stretched by having to consider chemical interactions, or the need to re-assess chemicals as their usage changes, or new information becomes available. \nAs a result of limited resources and insufficient chemical data, chemicals can enter into widespread use, causing AEs, community concern, and a reduction in the public’s confidence in regulators. \nMy approach is to consider whether published scientific literature can provide clues on which chemicals are showing a pattern of proceeding towards requiring regulatory action. By recognising such “chemicals of interest”, a regulator may focus its limited resources on testing a relatively small number of chemicals. The intent is to recognise AE-causing chemicals more quickly, allowing a regulator to apply management in a more timely manner.\nRecent publications or reports on emerging chemicals\nWhyte, J. M., “Project 1: Predicting the Emergence of ‘Chemicals of Interest’ via the Study of Scientific Publications”, Centre for Environmental and Economic Research report for NSW Environment Protection Authority, January 2021. Abstract: Modern economies employ a large volume and variety of chemicals. Yet, regulators typically have limited resources for conducting risk assessments. Further, the laboratory data available for chemical assessments is often insufficient. Consequently, chemicals in various jurisdictions (such as the per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, PFAS) have entered into widespread use, at which point Adverse Effects (AEs, including environmental impacts and health risks) are recognised. A regulator must then ‘reactively’ manage chemical risks and impacts. This report develops an approach to assisting a regulator’s task of anticipating risks due to ‘emerging contaminants’ that does not depend on chemical data. Instead, we propose to detect risks by considering the ‘research interest’ relating to individual chemicals and their AEs in a database of scientific publications (Web of Science) across a time interval. We consider a range of chemicals, some regulated, and some unregulated. We hypothesise that the research interest into regulated chemicals will have features that are absent from the research interest of unregulated chemicals. Then, by learning these features, we can use them in a classification process able to distinguish those chemicals likely to require regulation from others. Such information would allow a regulator to focus its limited resources on assessing a smaller number of chemicals than previously. Ultimately, this should lead to an earlier recognition of chemical AEs, and hence, more timely regulation of these. This action should reduce harm to human and environmental health, and disruption to industry. Following data exploration and the development of our method with reference to a training data set, our classification results on a validation set are promising. We note avenues for refinement of our data mining and time-series classification methods that should lead to improved results. Download File\nWhyte, J.

The broad question here is:  Ιf we can propose a model structure (collection of related models) to represent a physical system, can we control the system, or predict its behaviour? \nModel structure analysis: success in modelling may be determined by the nature of the model structure we use. More data and better quality data may not remedy a study destined to fail due to undesirable model properties.  If estimation of model parameters leads to multiple values that are equally feasible, what does this mean?   (Hint: problems with reproducibility of results are possible. If alternative parameter estimates lead the model structure to produce dissimilar predictions, we cannot predict system behaviour with confidence.) However, we can anticipate this type of problem prior to data collection through interrogating the assumed model structure.\nEmerging Chemical Pollutants\nWe could call these projects4 “Environmental Data Science”. Consider the PFAS (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances), which entered into widespread use. Some of these chemicals were then found to have adverse effects on human and environmental health. Regulators must now reactively manage this problem.  How can mathematics and statistics give regulators advance warning of tomorrow’s nightmares?

These relate state variables (x), observables (y) and possibly inputs (u) through parametric expressions in the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\): \\[\\begin{gather}\n\\dot{\\bf x}({\\bf x}, {\\bf u}, t; {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) = {\\bf f}({\\bf x}, {\\bf u}, t; {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) \\, , \\quad {\\bf x}(0) = {\\bf x_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\\\\n{\\bf y}({\\bf x}, {\\bf u}, t; {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) = {\\bf g}({\\bf x}, {\\bf u}, t; {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) \\, .\n\\end{gather}\\] Suppose we have an infinite, error-free record of data, and a correctly specified model structure (composed of parametric relationships between variables). Is it possible to obtain a unique estimate for each parameter? If not, and if alternative parameter estimates produce very different predictions, we cannot make predictions with confidence. This may cause our study to be an unproductive use of time, effort, and resources.\nI have considered the problem for model structures used in various biological settings.\nAnalysis of linear switching systems representing (e.g.) biosensor data: \nOptical biosensor experiments1 provide a means of indirectly observing the interactions of biomolecular species in real time. The experimental setup features an immobilised analyte bound to a sensor surface, and an analyte in solution made to flow over this surface. A series of “kinetic” experiments aim to determine the rate constants of interactions. Experiments typically consist of two or more phases, delineated by a change in experimental conditions. For example, in the association phase, some concentration of analyte is made to flow over the surface for a specified time. In the dissociation phase, the solution is changed to buffer (zero analyte concentration).\nIn certain cases, the experimental output is appropriately modelled by a linear switching system (LSS). A LSS is a collection of linear time-invariant state-space systems, with a switch that determines which system is in effect at each time point. A schematic of the LSS output is shown in Figure 2 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A schematic of optical biosensor response for an experiment of tho phases, with the change in injected analyte concentration shown.\n\n\n\nAs standard methods in identifiability testing and parameter estimation are not appropriate for an LSS structure, it is necessary to design other methods.\nSee the abstract of my PhD thesis:2 “Global a priori identifiability of models of flow-cell optical biosensor experiments”, Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 98, no. 2 (2018): 350-352.\nPublications\nRecent publications on identifiability analysis\nWhyte, Jason M. “Branching out into Structural Identifiability Analysis with Maple: Interactive Exploration of Uncontrolled Linear Time-Invariant Structures.” in “Maple in Mathematics Education and Research.

Some approaches to the problem resulted from my analysis of linear switching systems.\nI would like to further explore visualisations that can help the user understand when a model structure lacks the property of SGI.\nVarious Other Interests and Links\nThe “Theory of Living Systems” webcast seminar series is good.\nThe Environmental Science Meeting for Australian Research Teams (EnviSMART) is a monthly online seminar series by environmental science researchers.\nThe homepage of the “Centre for Anthropogenic Pollution Impact and Management” (CAPIM) at The University of Melbourne.\nPython package SymPy is great for open-source symbolic algebra.\n\n\n\n",
