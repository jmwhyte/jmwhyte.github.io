      "contents": "\nOverview\nModern economies consume (and produce) tens of thousands of\nchemicals. In some countries, regulators would like to assess each new\nchemical before it enters into its nominated use. This could require\nlaboratory testing to determine chemical properties, such as persistence\nand toxicity. Ideally, regulators would be able to anticipate “emerging\nchemicals” which will adverse effects on human and environmental health\n(more concisely, AEs), and impose appropriate regulatory actions.\n\nHowever, as the case of PFAS (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances)\nshows, regulators may not have the resources to collect data on all\nchemicals. Further, a regulator’s resources may be further stretched by\nhaving to consider chemical interactions, or the need to re-assess\nchemicals as their usage changes, or new information becomes available.\n\nAs a result of limited resources and insufficient chemical data,\nchemicals can enter into widespread use, causing AEs, community concern,\nand a reduction in the public’s confidence in regulators. \nMy approach is to consider whether published scientific literature\ncan provide clues on which chemicals are showing a pattern of proceeding\ntowards requiring regulatory action. By recognising such “chemicals of\ninterest”, a regulator may focus its limited resources on testing a\nrelatively small number of chemicals. The intent is to recognise\nAE-causing chemicals more quickly, allowing a regulator to apply\nmanagement in a more timely manner.\nRecent\npublications or reports on emerging chemicals\nWhyte, J.

Pre-publication,\npost-review version here. Summary: This\nconference paper laid the groundwork for a subsequent consultancy. The\nresults showed that my approach could anticipate chemicals of concern\nearlier than a regulator could. This result has encouraged further\nresearch in this area.\nWork in progress\nWhyte, J.

These relate state variables\n(x), observables (y) and possibly\ninputs (u) through parametric expressions in the\nparameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\):\n\\[\\begin{gather}\n\\dot{\\bf x}({\\bf x}, {\\bf u}, t; {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) = {\\bf f}({\\bf\nx}, {\\bf u}, t; {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) \\, , \\quad {\\bf x}(0) = {\\bf\nx_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\\\\n{\\bf y}({\\bf x}, {\\bf u}, t; {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) = {\\bf g}({\\bf x},\n{\\bf u}, t; {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) \\, .\n\\end{gather}\\] Suppose we have an infinite, error-free record of\ndata, and a correctly specified model structure (composed of parametric\nrelationships between variables).

The experimental setup features an immobilised analyte\nbound to a sensor surface, and an analyte in solution made to\nflow over this surface. A series of “kinetic” experiments aim to\ndetermine the rate constants of interactions. Experiments typically\nconsist of two or more phases, delineated by a change in experimental\nconditions. For example, in the association phase, some\nconcentration of analyte is made to flow over the surface for a\nspecified time. In the dissociation phase, the solution is\nchanged to buffer (zero analyte concentration).\nIn certain cases, the experimental output is appropriately modelled\nby a linear switching system (LSS). A LSS is a collection of linear\ntime-invariant state-space systems, with a switch that determines which\nsystem is in effect at each time point. A schematic of the LSS output is\nshown in Figure 2 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A schematic of optical biosensor response\nfor an experiment of tho phases, with the change in injected analyte\nconcentration shown.\n\n\n\nAs standard methods in identifiability testing and parameter\nestimation are not appropriate for an LSS structure, it is necessary to\ndesign other methods.\nSee the abstract of my PhD thesis:2 “Global\na priori identifiability of models of flow-cell optical\nbiosensor experiments”, Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical\nSociety 98, no. 2 (2018): 350-352.\nPublications\nRecent\npublications on identifiability analysis\nWhyte, Jason M. “Branching\nout into Structural Identifiability Analysis with Maple: Interactive\nExploration of Uncontrolled Linear Time-Invariant\nStructures.” in “Maple in Mathematics Education and\nResearch.

I would\nlike to investigate this further in case this can lead to the\noptimisation of treatment times.\nI have Python routines written for JuPYTeR notebooks that assist\nthe non-specialist in the testing of model structures for structural\nglobal identifiability (SGI).\nThe progression of an infectious disease through a population\ncould behave like a linear switching system if some intervention\n(e.g. lockdown, mask wearing) happened at a particular point. I would\nlike to apply my methods to such a system.\nSometimes Maple is unable to simplify complex expressions. Some\napproaches to the problem resulted from my analysis of linear switching\nsystems.\nI would like to further explore visualisations that can help the\nuser understand when a model structure lacks the property of\nSGI.\nVarious Other Interests and\nLinks\nThe “Theory of\nLiving Systems” webcast seminar series is good.\nThe Environmental Science Meeting for Australian Research Teams\n(EnviSMART)\nis a monthly online seminar series by environmental science\nresearchers.\nThe homepage of the “Centre for Anthropogenic Pollution Impact\nand Management” (CAPIM) at\nThe University of Melbourne.\nPython package SymPy is great for open-source symbolic\nalgebra.\n\n\n\n",
