  My PhD relates to the use of flow-cell optical biosensors to indirectly study the dynamics of biomolecular interactions. This led to interest in variety of problems. <br>

## Structural global identifiability (SGI)? <br>
This concept lurks wherever we wish to "calibrate" a model structure (estimate parameters from data) so that we can proceed to make predictions. <br>

Often we can represent a physical system by a structure of "state-space" systems. These relate state variables (**x**),
observables (**y**) and possibly inputs (**u**) through parametric expressions in the parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$:
\begin{gather}
\dot{\bf x}({\bf x}, {\bf u}, t; {\boldsymbol{\theta}}) = {\bf f}({\bf x}, {\bf u}, t; {\boldsymbol{\theta}}) \, , \quad {\bf x}(0) = {\bf x_{0}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
{\bf y}({\bf x}, {\bf u}, t; {\boldsymbol{\theta}}) = {\bf g}({\bf x}, {\bf u}, t; {\boldsymbol{\theta}}) \, .
\end{gather}
Suppose we have an infinite, error-free record of data, and a correctly specified model structure (composed of parametric relationships between variables). Is it possible to obtain a unique estimate for each parameter?
If not, and if alternative parameter estimates produce very different predictions, we cannot make predictions with confidence. This may cause our study to be an unproductive use of time, effort, and resources. 

I have considered the problem for model structures used in various biological settings.

## Analysis of linear switching systems representing (e.g.) biosensor data: <br>
Optical biosensor experiments^[For a cool video introduction, look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6z_1rAaduE&t=9s)] provide a means of indirectly observing the interactions of biomolecular species in real time. The experimental setup features an _immobilised analyte_ bound to a sensor surface, and an _analyte_ in solution made to flow over this surface. A series of "kinetic" experiments aim to determine the rate constants of interactions. Experiments typically consist of two or more phases, delineated by a change in experimental conditions. For example, in the _association_ phase, some concentration of analyte is made to flow over the surface for a specified time. 
In the _dissociation_ phase, the solution is changed to buffer (zero analyte concentration).

In certain cases, the experimental output is appropriately modelled by a linear switching system (LSS). A LSS is a collection of linear time-invariant state-space systems, with a switch that determines which system is in effect at each time point. A schematic of the LSS output is shown in 
Figure \@ref(fig:BIAcore-response-sample) below.

```{r BIAcore-response-sample, fig.align="center", fig.cap='A schematic of optical biosensor response for an experiment of tho phases, with the change in injected analyte concentration shown.',  out.width='0.75\\linewidth', fig.pos='H'}
knitr::include_graphics("BIA-usual-graphV2.png")
```
As standard methods in identifiability testing and parameter estimation are not appropriate for an LSS structure, it is necessary to design other methods.
