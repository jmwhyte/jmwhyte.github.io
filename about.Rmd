Site created June 1st 2021 (under Melbourne lockdown V4): <br>
site in development, maybe I can find some good pictures. <br>

I am an Associate Investigator in the ARC Centre for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS). <br>

I'm more creative than you would expect from this website; learning^[and footnote creation] is ongoing.<br>
  
#### Quotes I like
"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.", <br>
Michelangelo.

"Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.", <br>
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

"The mill grinds slowly, but it grinds incredibly fine.", <br>
Charles E. M. Pearce
